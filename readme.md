## mathematical modeling algorithms

Here are some algorithms implemented in Python, might be helpful for learning algorithms details, but for accuracy and efficiency it's still recommended to use third party libraries like SciPy.

### Contents

* Genetic_Algorithms_tsp.py: solving travelling salesman problem(tsp) using genetic algorithm
* SA_tsp.py: solving tsp using simulated annealing(SA) algorithm
* SA_01problem.py: solving 0-1 packaging problem using SA algorithm
* grey_model.py: time series forceasting using GM(1, 1) model

### Usage
Make sure numpy is installed in current Python environment, then run script to get outputs.
